# entity-txn

A Clojure library to support transactions for CRUD operations on domain type instances.

Documentation can be found [here](https://inqwell.github.io/entity-txn/index.html)

`entity-txn` can be used in conjunction with [`entity-core`](https://github.com/inqwell/entity-core)
and [`entity-sql`](https://github.com/inqwell/entity-sql) to provide a CRUD stack in Clojure and
burying SQL from your application code.

## Usage

`[entity/entity-txn "0.1.0"]`

## TODO
Something like a pet store example for better illustration. In the
meantime the tests show individual use cases.
